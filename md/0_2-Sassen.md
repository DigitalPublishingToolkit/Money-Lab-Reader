# When Money Becomes an Extraction Tool Rather Than Exchange Medium: Foreword to the MoneyLab Reader

### Saskia Sassen {.author}

MoneyLab is an exciting and strategic project. The diversity of
contributions to this volume is exceptional and promising. It is
impossible to do justice to this enormous variety of ideas and proposals
in a short preface. I will focus on what we might think of as one step,
one building block in the larger debate engaged by MoneyLab: the need to
develop new types of currencies to enable new types of economies.

We need exchange mediums, such as money. But today’s versions of money
are mostly the official currencies of countries. And these are becoming
extremely problematic. Why? Because they function less and less as an
exchange medium and more and more as a tool for governments and
corporations to extract household resources for their aims, often
overriding the basic needs of a country’s people.

The official currencies of countries today have become a bridge into
household resources – a mechanism for extracting value from even poor
households. Taxation without citizen participation in how to spend those
taxes is another mechanism. The corporatizing of economies is yet
another. When corporations capture most of what consumers spend then
they also disproportionately control how that household money is
invested and allocated (for instance, extreme increases in corporate
salaries rather than investing in developing organic food).

Under these conditions, money is no longer simply an exchange medium.
Nor is it a medium for ensuring large-scale investments – by either
governments or corporations – into what a locality, a country, needs for
its people. It becomes an instrument for implementing what governments
and corporations want.

Yet not all alternative moneys are necessarily desirable. The key is a
decentralized currency to enable the proliferation of non-corporate
economies, and to do so at scales and with modalities that go beyond
simple barter. Barter is fine for many operations, and it has thrived in
certain settings, notably in parts of Latin America. But it is not
enough. We need to scale-up if we are going to take back economic
terrain now fully captured by large corporations. And we need to do
this, even if some of the larger needs of a locality, notably transport
systems, will have to be built by large corporations.

Digital currencies are clearly one option. Most recently Bitcoin has
drawn a lot of the attention. It has also become a destination for
speculative investment. This has in turn raised some key questions,
notably whether it is a decentralized currency. The challenge is to
avoid the corporatizing of a currency, which is now the situation with
more and more official currencies.

Again, by corporatizing I mean that it serves to transform household
resources (as measured by consumption capacity) into corporate profits,
which can then be invested without any concern or need to know a
locality’s demands. Mostly, a modest firm that depends on a locality’s
choices is going to have to be responsive in a way that the large
corporation is not. Further, the power of large corporations to set up
franchises which might have to be a bit more responsive to a locality’s
needs, mostly winds up eliminating the locally owned businesses so the
franchise can rule uncontested – a take it or leave it stance vis-à-vis
the locality. Finally, and inevitably, the franchise has to pass on some
of the locality’s consumption capacity to central headquarters. Ideally,
a decentralized currency would favor local initiatives and
redistribution in localities.

In the last twenty years this shift towards the corporatizing of
household money has accelerated and become increasingly acute in more
and more of the world. Up to a certain point we need governments and
corporations for some of our needs: vast transport systems, public
buildings, airports, harbors, and so on. But much of this far too easily
winds up using our money for their profit rather than our needs. One
result is growing asymmetries of all sorts, marked by growing
concentrations of wealth and expanded impoverishment at the other end.
There are exceptions here and there, but they are not enough to
obliterate these asymmetries.

Further, to some extent our governments have enabled the power of
corporations to extract household money not just via consumption but
also via their policies. The elegantly named ‘quantitative-easing’ is
one such example. In this post-2008 crisis period, the US has been the
most active government in transferring households’ money to
corporations, especially big banks and major financial firms. Only a
small portion of this (US\$ 320 billion) has been via proper channels –
the legislature, where there is a chance of a public debate where we the
citizens can, in principle, voice our take on it all. But by far most
has been done secretly, and we only found out via freedom of information
requests how our money was spent: over \$7 trillion dollars were
secretly transferred from US households to the global banking system.
Several trillion more were transferred via quantitative easing, a public
event, but incomprehensible to the average household; this is language
that does not spell out that it is households’ money that is being
transferred. Quantitative easing is also what the European Central Bank
wants to implement in the European Union.

Yes, we need decentralized currencies that function as genuine exchange
mediums to handle a vast range of the needs of households, modest firms
and localities. It would mean avoiding franchises and establishing
locally owned operations – the profits then recirculate in the community
or city rather than partly being captured by corporate headquarters. At
the same time, we need national currencies to engage in the vast
infrastructural and servicing projects that a country requires to
address the needs of its people; and this may mean contracting with
large engineering corporations. But this should not be necessary for
most of the food, furniture and such.

Decentralized currencies should enable bringing significant components
of our modern economies back into our communities. And if these
currencies are digitized, local initiatives and innovations can get
replicated across a region, country’s or a continent’s localities.
This is one way of constructing larger multi-nodal operational spaces
that can cut across diverse types of boundaries without losing their
local insertion.

What we do not need is what is happening today in a growing number of
countries: the large scale direct and indirect appropriation of the
income of households and of modest firms to finance the profit-seeking
aims of corporations.
