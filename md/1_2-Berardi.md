# Is There Life Beyond Money?

### Franco "Bifo" Berardi {.author}

I’m far from being an expert in the field of finance. So I should
explain why I’m writing on the subject of money. The problem is that
money invaded the space of everyday life, spreading far beyond the mere
space of the economy, and turning into a sort of all pervading fluid.

The expanding pervasiveness of the economic sphere in social life is a
marking feature of modern capitalism, after the dissolution of the
traditional forms of subsistence economy. The expanding pervasiveness of
money in the economic sphere is the marking feature of contemporary
financial capitalism that can be named semiocapital, simply because
signs take the prominent place in the process of production. Money is
certainly a sign, and this sign has a history. While in the past of
industrial capitalism it was a referential sign, representing a certain
amount of physical things – today it is a self-referential sign that has
acquired the power of mobilizing and dismantling the social forces of
production. Since the end of the fixed regime of monetary exchange, the
arbitrary game of financial speculation has taken the central place of
the global economy: the consequence is the aleatority of every relation
between things, and the precarization of every relation between persons.

One after the other every space of daily life – learning, affection, sex
– is invaded by the brutality of the arbitrary power of money, and the
undifferentiated abstraction swallows every dimension of experience,
depriving it of its special flavor and concreteness.
This is why the discourse on money can no longer be reserved to the
experts in financial science; this is why I’m going to discuss money and
finance.

While money has turned into the gate of access to any kind of
experience, the access to money has become more and more difficult for
the majority of people: precarity and unemployment spread all over,
particularly among young people. Neoliberal privatization strips a large
part of society of welfare, forcing people to fight for the elementary
requirements of survival.

At a certain point, particularly in the wake of the financial collapse
of September 2008, many people who, like me, do not have any special
interest in financial science have been obliged to try to understand the
incomprehensible words of the financial agents in order to try and
resist the aggression that the financial abstraction was waging against
our concrete lives.

At the beginning of the new century the so called dotcom crash dissolved
the illusion of an alliance between cognitive workers and venture
capital, the alliance that in the 90s has made possible the creation
and spread of the net. After the first crisis of the virtual economy in
the year 2000, disempowered cognitive workers entered the cycle of
precarization. Then the society at large was attacked by the menace of a
metaphysical debt.

At the end of the 90s Jean Baudrillard wrote:

>The debt will never be paid. No debt will ever be paid. The final counts
will never take place. If time is counted, the missing money is beyond
counting. The United States is already virtually unable to pay, but this
will have no consequence whatsoever. There will be no judgment day for
this virtual bankruptcy. It is simple enough to enter an exponential or
virtual mode to become free of any responsibility, since there is no
reference anymore, no referential world to serve as a measuring
norm.[^1_2-Berardi_1]

The prediction of Baudrillard proved false: the orbitalization of the
debt has failed. The debt, which was in orbit around the globe has
fallen down, and is haunting the economy of the West. Facing the
de-orbitalization of the debt, the financial class multiplied the
attempts to create value from nothing. But in order to do that, the
financial class is turning the products and
institutions of social activity into nothing. A sort of black hole began to swallow
the richness produced in the last two hundred years, particularly in
Europe. The credit derivatives market is the place where destruction
replaces production. Since the ’80s, when ‘futures’ became commonplace
in the deregulated financial markets, financial agencies have started to
invest their money in a paradoxical way: if they win they cash money, if
they lose they cash more money from insurances on credit default swaps
and similar financial tricks.

The old industrial model of accumulation was based on the cycle M-G-M
(Money-Goods-more Money). The new financial model of accumulation is
based on the cycle M-P-M (Money-Predation-more Money), which implies the
following: Money-Social impoverishment-more Money. This is the origin of
the black hole that is swiftly dissipating the legacy of industrial
labor and of the very structures of modern civilization. As an attractor
and destroyer of the future, financial capitalism is capturing energies
and resources and transforming them into monetary abstraction: nothing.
In 2008, financial emergency was declared after the collapse of the
American derivative market and of Lehmann Brothers: as a
consequence society at large was forced to pay for the reckless
dissipation brought about by these financial dynamics.

In the wake of the 2008 breakdown a wave of movements spread in many
cities of the world, creating new expectations. While the financial
abstraction was swallowing the life and future of the new generation, a
movement of unprecedented extent exploded reaching a peak in the year
2011. The London riots of November 2010, the Spanish *acampada* of May
and June 2011, and the Greek resistance of students,
precarious workers, artists, and intellectuals tried to overthrow the
financial dictatorship. In vain.

In the Spring of 2011 the Arab cities saw a large uprising of young
people against local dictators and global financial capitalism, but the
movement of precarious cognitive workers, the avant-garde of the
Egyptian and Syrian rebellions, proved unable to lead a long lasting
democratic transformation of their countries, and the process was
hijacked and diverted by all kinds of identitarian fanaticism.

In September 2011 the uprising exploded in New York City, the very heart
of financial globalism. The outburst of Occupy Wall Street was followed
by a fresh wave of occupations aimed at the reactivation of the social
body of cognitive precarious labor. The global uprising has obviously
involved different social forces according to the diversity of the areas
where it erupted, but precarious cognitarians mobilized everywhere
giving the global process a common character and meaning. The search for
autonomy of knowledge and technology to escape from the grip of
financial capitalism is the common content of the cognitarian forces,
which are the innovative core of the uprising.

Everywhere cognitive workers – students, researchers, journalists,
artists, and programmers – have been at the frontline of the
mobilization, precariousness has been their main concern everywhere, and
autonomy of knowledge and technology has been their main issue. The
attempt to resist and subvert the corporate capture of knowledge and
skills has thus been the defining novelty of this movement.
Media-activism, the development of P2P technologies, and the
experimentation with alternative currencies can be viewed as examples of
the attempt to re-appropriate the product of knowledge, while the
occupation of spaces – the overall process named Occupy – has been the
example of a process of recomposition of the erotic body of society
trying to connect with the cognitive potency of the general intellect.

In the days of Spring 2011, with a group of students and professors of
the Academy of Brera, I went to the Milano Stock Exchange building, and
together we occupied that space. The police came, and forced us out.
Then we occupied the square where the beautiful monument by Maurizio
Cattelan is raising the middle finger towards the sky just in front of
the temple of finance.

In the air there was the expectation of an uprising, of a wave of
solidarity and resolve to stop capitalist aggression. Provided
that in the future there will be people who can remember, the year 2011
will be recorded as the year of an enigmatic insurrection, an
insurrection full of rage and indignation but devoid of solidarity and
perseverance, an uprising that immediately after gave way to the
sentiment of a deep rooted impotence. Notwithstanding many scattered
events of protest and revolt, the movement proved unable to unite in a
general European upheaval, and finally pulled back, and sunk in the
livid waters of depression where we are at the moment. This is why a
non-expert like me dares to speak about a highly specialized subject as
the adventures of money; the best way to speak of financial matters
nowadays is to start from an understanding of the effects that
monetarism has provoked on work and society.

## Money and Work

‘The workday is not an extension of human nature; long working hours
are not rooted in need and are not something that workers have
willingly, freely or joyfully agreed to…’[^1_2-Berardi_2]

My point of view will be the recent history of work, particularly the
imposed extension of work time. In *The New York
Times* columnist Frank Bruni wrote the following, referring to the recent
surge in American employment rate, after the crisis that followed the
2008 financial collapse: ‘The new jobs don’t feel as sturdy as the old
ones. It takes more hours to make the same money or support the same
lifestyle. Students amass debt. Upward mobility increasingly seems a
mirage, a myth.’[^1_2-Berardi_3]

It takes more hours to make the same money. This is the crucial
transformation that is a result of the neoliberal policy, and has
been pushed by the financial class. Western workers are working more and
more and earning less and less.

In 1998 Aronowitz and Cutler already wrote in *Post-Work*:

>We can understand the political history of the last thirty years in
terms of the largely successful effort of the Right to impose social
amnesia on the American people, to snuff out the memory of a time we
began to seriously consider a post work future. Organized labor has
given up its historical demand for shorter hours at no reduction of pay
and has instead come to accept the thinking that shorter hours involves
a reduction in total wages. Labor has abandoned its engagement in the
struggle for control over the workday. People no longer imagine the
possibility of the end of work. The workaholic model, once regarded as
an individual pathology, has become the enforced, ethically approved
standard: the workday has again become the central feature of human
existence.[^1_2-Berardi_4]

In the last decades – since Margaret Thatcher’s rise to power in the United Kingdom – the workers of the
world have been subjected to the most ferocious aggression imaginable. The
factory workers in the early 20th century had
negotiated the reduction of work time, and in the 1960s and 70s the alliance between factory workers and knowledge workers opened the way to general automation of production and
emancipation of human life from the chains of work. The neoliberal
reversal of the scene, since the late 70s, has marked the beginning of a
never-ending class war waged by capitalists against society and against
workers. 

Democracy, friendship, and the pleasures of life have been trashed during this
war. 

In the aftermath of the First World War, in the days of Roosevelt’s New
Deal, the emancipation of social time from the unnecessary (less and
less necessary) daily obligation of salaried work began to be
envisioned as a possibility. In the decades prior to the worldwide
movement of ’68, many believed the eight-hour day was just the beginning
of the struggle to reduce working hours further. Time for education,
time for self-care, time for friendship, affection and pleasure: this
was the agenda of the age of democracy and progress. This was not a
utopia, but the pragmatic expectation of conscious workers and
progressive intellectuals in an era with large developments in new
technologies for automation. 

But the accumulation of value is based on the exploitation of human
time, and power is based on the hierarchical division of social time, therefore
capitalists and their ideological agents never lost sight of their goal:
namely to re-establish ten or twelve hours hour work days as the cultural standard. They enforce
discipline by any means: the blackmail of misery, the violence of war,
and the pervasive potency of advertising, ideology and consumerism. As
Aronowitz and Cutler write: ‘consumption was created as a new motive: a
new human nature was constructed around an insatiable need to shop and
accumulate commodities of all kinds.’[^1_2-Berardi_5]

The cultural reduction of individual needs and habits to uniformity, the
mass production of material expectations and the massive commodification
of desire is the totalitarian pre-condition of the process of subjection
of social time to the dictatorship of work. The privatization of daily
life – individual houses, nuclear families, private transportation
– promoted as a condition of freedom has resulted in cultural manacles,
the condition of a form of slavery which, blended with puritanical
ideology, finally intoxicates life and culture and politics.

Elisabeth Kolbert argues:

>According to Keynes the size of the global economy would increase
sevenfold in the following century, and this, in concert with
ever-greater “technical improvements”, would usher in the fifteen-hour
week. Keynes assumed that people work in order to earn enough to buy
what they need. And so, he reasoned, as incomes rose, those needs could
be fulfilled in ever fewer hours. Workers would knock off earlier and
earlier, until eventually they’d be going home by lunchtime. But that
isn’t what people are like. Instead of quitting early, they find new
things to need. Many of the new things they’ve found weren’t even around
when Keynes was writing – laptops, microwaves, Xboxes, smartphones,
smart watches, smart refrigerators, Prada totes, True Religion jeans,
battery-powered meat thermometers, those gizmos you stick in the freezer
and then into your beer to keep it cold as you drink it. Suggestively,
what’s come to be known as the “long-hours premium” – the return that
salaried employees effectively receive for each hour of work they put in
beyond the usual forty – has more than doubled in the past thirty
years.[^1_2-Berardi_6]

According to Joseph Stiglitz consumption choices become
self-reinforcing. We ‘learn how to consume by consuming,’ he writes, and
how to ‘enjoy leisure by enjoying leisure’.[^1_2-Berardi_7] Most people feel bad
when they are not obliged to work all day long. They do not know what to
do, because they have never learned what life might be in conditions of
freedom. 

Money is crucial in this process: money, in fact is a sort of universal
*ersatz*: it is making life possible but simultaneously it is replacing
life. In exchange for money people accept to give away their life. So
what is money? Money is the tool that shapes life as a container of
exchangeable time. Thanks to money our life can be translated in the
language of universal exchange, but also in the language of accumulation
of (exchanged) time. 

Can we imagine the reversal of the function that money has historically
fulfilled? Can we imagine, as some theorists have recently proposed, a
sort of ‘money of the commons’?  The crucial function of such ‘money of
the commons’ should be to reduce the workers dependence on the economic
constraints that force them to accept any blackmail, and particularly
force them to sell their labor time for an unfair salary in
precarious conditions.

## A Digression About Language and Money

Thanks to Wittgenstein I know that the limits of my language are the
limits of my world.[^1_2-Berardi_8] When we talk of ‘limit’ however we are dealing
with two dimensions: what is here, inside the space of our limited
world, and what is there, beyond the limit. The limit is the tangle in
which our world is captured, and it is a linguistic tangle. How can we
disentangle the possible from the present form of the world? 

What Wittgenstein says about the limit of language has interesting
implications at the political level: social communication is limiting
the range of political imagination. What we cannot imagine we cannot do,
and we cannot imagine what is excluded from the field of the
expressible. Money, by this point of view, can be considered as a
formidable limit to our imagination.

According to Marx money is the general equivalent, the translator of any
thing into every other thing. In some parts of his work (namely in the
*Grundrisse*) Marx suggests that money is not only a signifier, whose
signified is infinitely varied, but is also an engine, a source of
energy that transcends referentiality and measurability.

Since French and Russian Symbolists declared that the intention of the
poet is not to describe but to evoke, the late modern poetry revolution
is based on the emancipation of the sign from the referent.
Mallarmé’s words are no longer intended to designate the real, but are
intended to evoke the real, to make the real emerge from nothingness.
Virtual technology has made real the old Symbolist dream of evocation,
in many ways. The monetary sphere in the second part of the 20th century
becomes a force of evocation, a magical circulation of something that does
not exist.

The current financialization of the economy demands self-referentiality
of the monetary system as a condition. In fact, financial accumulation
is essentially based on the automation of the relation between financial
algorithms and the dynamics of production and exchange. The financial
function (which once upon a time was dependent on the general interests
of capitalism) has now become the automated language of the economy, a
sur-codification, which is subjecting the sphere of reality (production
and exchange) to a mathematical rationale that is not inherent to the
rationale of production itself.

Nixon’s decision in 1971 to emancipate the American dollar from the
universal regime of fixed exchange, presumed that the
financial variable is independent from any referent, and is only based
on the arbitrary power of self-regulation and self-affirmation. The
creation of the digital web paved the way to the automation of the
relation between financial code and economic dynamics, and therefore
social life was subjected to financial semiotization.

Chomsky’s structural theory is based on the idea that linguistic signs
can be exchanged in a bank of shared structures: a common cognitive
competence makes the exchange possible. Language is therefore, like
money, a general equivalent and universal translator of different goods. We
can exchange everything with money, as we can exchange everything with
words.[^1_2-Berardi_9]

But money (like language, of course) is also a tool for the mobilization
of energies, a pragmatic act of self-expansion. In the sphere of
financial capitalism money is less an indicator than a factor of
mobilization. It is suitable to provoke participation or
submission. Look at the reality of debt, look at the awful effects of
impoverishment and exploitation that debt is provoking in the body of
society. Debt is a transformation of money into blackmail. Money, which
was supposed to be the measure of value, has been turned into a tool for
psychic and social subjugation. This metaphysical debt is linking money,
language, and guilt. Debt is guilt, and as guilt it is entering the
domain of the unconscious, and shaping language according to structures of
power and submission.

Language and money have something in common: from a
physical point of view they are nothing, yet they move everything in human history. Words
move people to believe, words create expectations and the impulse to act
in the pursuit of their goals. Words are tools for persuasion and the
mobilization of psychic energies. Money acts similarly, based on trust,
on the belief that a piece of paper means everything that can be bought and sold in the world.

In* *‘Money The Poor Man’s Credit Card’,* *chapter fourteen
of *Understanding Media*, Marshall McLuhan writes:

> Money talks, because money is a metaphor, a transfer, and a bridge.
> Like words and language, money is a storehouse of communally achieved
> work, skill, and experience. Money, however, is also a specialist

> community.[^1_2-Berardi_10]

Money is a tool for the simplification of social relations, and it makes
possible the automation of acts of enunciation. While the industrial
automaton was mechanical and thermodynamical and consisted, as Marx
writes in *Fragment on Machines,* ‘of numerous mechanical and
intellectual organs so that workers themselves are cast merely as its
conscious linkages’*,* the digital automaton is electro-computational,
involves* *the nervous system, and unfolds in networks of electronic and
nervous connections. The bio-informational automaton is the product of
the insertion of the digital automaton in the flow of socio-linguistic
interactions.

## Abstraction and Automation

Abstraction is the main trend of the last century in the field of art,
language, and the economy. Abstraction can be defined as the mental
extraction of a concept from a series of real experiences, but it can be
also defined as the separation of the conceptual dynamics from the
bodily process. Since Marx spoke of ‘abstract labor’ in order to
refer to the working activity as separate from the useful production of
concrete things, we know that abstraction is a powerful engine. Thanks to
abstraction, capitalism has detached the process of valorization from
the material process of production. As productive labor turns into a
process of info-production, abstraction becomes the main source of
accumulation, and the condition of automation. Automation is the
insertion of abstraction into the machinery of social life, and
consequently it is the replacement of an action (physical and cognitive)
with a technical engine. From the point of view of cultural history the
first part of the 20th century is marked by the emancipation of the sign
from its referential function: this may be seen as the general trend of
late modernity, the prevailing tendency in literature and art as well as
in science and in politics.

In the second part of the century, the monetary sign reclaims its
autonomy, and since Nixon’s decision, following the process of
monetary deregulation, the arbitrary self-definition of monetary
dynamics is established: money shifts from referential to
self-referential signification. This is the condition for the automation
of the monetary sphere, and for the submission of social life to this
sphere of abstraction. Automation, which is electronic, does not
represent physical work so much as programmed knowledge. As work is
replaced by the sheer movement of information, money as a store of work
merges with the informational forms of credit and credit cards.[^1_2-Berardi_11]

Retracing the history of money, from exchange commodity to
representative money to standard value to electronic abstraction,
McLuhan writes:

> The Gutenberg technology created a vast new republic of letters, and
> stirred great confusion about the boundaries between the realms of
> literature and life. Representative money, based on print technology,
> created new speedy dimensions of credit that were quite inconsistent
> with the inert mass of bullion and of commodity money. Yet all efforts
> were bent to make the speedy new money behave like the slow bullion
> coach. J. M. Keynes stated this policy in *A Treatise on Money*: Thus
> the long age of Commodity Money has at last passed finally away before
> the age of Representative Money. Gold has ceased to be a coin, a
> hoard, a tangible claim to wealth, of which the value cannot slip away
> so long as the hand of the individual clutches the material stuff. It
> has become a much more abstract thing - just a standard of value; and
> it only keeps this nominal status by being handed round from time to
> time in quite small quantities amongst a group of Central Banks.[^1_2-Berardi_12]

Only when it is abstracted (separated from the referent, and
dis-embodied) can the monetary dynamics be automated and submitted to the
rules of a non-referential sphere of signification and attribution of
value. Information takes the place of things, and finance – which once
upon a time used to be the sphere where productive projects could meet
capital, and where capitals could meet productive projects, emancipates
itself from the constraints of physical production: the process of
capital valorization (increase of money invested) no longer passes
through the creation of use value. As the referent is cancelled and
financial accumulation is enabled by the mere circulation of money, the
production of goods become superfluous. The accumulation of abstract value depends on the subjection
of the population to debt, and on the predation of existing resources.
This emancipation of capital accumulation from the production of useful
things results in the dismantling of social welfare.

In the sphere of the financial economy, the acceleration of financial
circulation and valorization implies the elimination of the concrete
usefulness of products because the faster information circulates, the
faster value is accumulated, and purely financial information is the
fastest of things, while the production and distribution of goods is
slow. The process of realizing capital, namely the exchange of
goods with money, slows the pace of monetary accumulation. The same phenomenon happens in the field of communication: the less meaningful the message,
the faster, given that meaning production and interpretation takes time,
while the circulation of pure information with no meaning is
instantaneous.

In the last twenty years computers, electronic exchanges, dark pools,
flash orders, multiple exchanges, alternative trading venues, direct
access brokers, OTC derivatives, and high-frequency traders have totally
changed the financial landscape and particularly the relation between
human operators and self-directing algorithmic automatons. The more you
remove references to physical things, physical resources, and the body,
the more you can accelerate the circulation of financial flows. This is
why at the end of this process of abstraction-acceleration value does
not emerge from a physical relationship between work and things, but
rather from infinite self-replication of virtual exchanges of nothing
with nothing. 

## Alternative Currencies and the Automation Trend

Is it possible to undo the financial system from the inside? Is it
possible to use money as a lever against the financial trap and against
the obligation to precarious labor? Some open-minded techno-financial
agents, and also groups of social activists are promoting the idea that
alternative currencies can be useful in that sense.

The open minded financial agents are inspired by the libertarian
persuasion that the economic sphere has to be free from the State, and
from centralized monetary control. The social activists are looking for
a possibility to democratize the financial sphere. Can the function of
money be subverted? Can money be used as a tool for disentangling social
life and production from financial capitalism, which is using the
monetary dynamics as a tool for subsuming knowledge and work? Or should
we rather come to the conclusion that money can only act as an
automator, the essential automator of social life? In that case we
should conclude that only by subtracting spaces of life from
monetary exchange and codification can we overcome the limit of money, as a linguistic codification of time, activity and life.

The Occupy movement that exploded in many cities of the world in 2011 was essentially an attempt in deconstructing the financial
automation of social life, an attempt in suspending the grip of the
financial machine over the process of production and distribution of
wealth. Despite its widespread effect at the symbolic level, despite its
ability to denounce the dangers of financialization of the economy, the
Occupy movement has been unable to fulfill its goal. The financial
automation of social life, and the implied dismantlement of the welfare
state and impoverishment of workers, seems unstoppable. So people have
to find the means for defending their life, their education, their
health. In the countries (like Greece, Spain, and Italy) that have suffered
most from the financial aggression, people have experimented with forms of
social self-help, mutual services, time banks, and alternative
currencies.

Insolvency – the active refusal to pay debt and undeserved taxation, the
refusal to pay for basic services, the permanent occupation of spaces
and buildings, and the sabotage of austerity – is the most effective way
to repel financial blackmail. But the organization of insolvency is
only possible when social solidarity is strong, and in the present
condition the links of solidarity are weak because of the precarization
of work. Despite mass protests in the streets,
people have not been able to keep solidarity alive in the long run. This
is why insolvency has not really grown roots in the social scene during
the last few years. Rudimentary forms of alternative currencies for local
exchange have begun appearing in many places in Europe, adding to experiences like sharing time and basic services and
goods. But community currencies can only become a significant form of
exchange when social solidarity is strong enough to nurture trust and
mutual help. More sophisticated forms of alternative currencies have
recently been promoted by high skilled programmers: Bitcoin being the best
known example. Generating money is a technical problem, but replacing
financial money with alternative money is a problem of trust. 

According to Giorgio Griziotti and Carlo Vercellone: ‘a money of the
common should take into account three essential elements, hardwired into
its algorithms and its implementation’:[^1_2-Berardi_13] 

> The impossibility to accumulate and thus impeding it from becoming the
> object of speculation. Consequently, it must lose some of its value
> over time. It would therefore be a currency that melts down, a
> ‘demurrage charged money’. Mitigating workers’ dependency on the
> economic restrictions that force them to sell their labor power and
> therefore wage relations themselves; thus reducing
> precarity. Allowing, on these premises, for more free time and
> resources for developing alternative forms of cooperation based on the
> common pooling of knowledge, production and, in any case, on exchange
> networks that exclude the logic of profit. Participation in networks
> where a currency of the common circulates implies adhering to these
> principles, whether participants are individuals, businesses or
> institutional subjects, as in the case of certain alternative currency
> models experimented with on a local level.[^1_2-Berardi_14]

Alternative currencies can act as a game changer, this is quite
possible, and it is already happening up to a certain point, but it is
not clear how they can act as a surrogate for a lack of social solidarity. Algorithmic
money may act as the ultimate tool for automation: automation of
behavior, language, relation, automation of evaluation and
exchange.

Regardless of the intentions of Bitcoin miners, their monetary
action is going to heighten the level of automation in the sphere of
social exchange. Coding personal relationships into a programming
language is the tendency: cryptomoney and cryptocontracts are
more and more turning the relations between people into the execution of a
programing language, into a sequence of acts that one must accomplish in
order to access the following step. The normative function of law is
replaced by the automatic implication of human agents reduced to
operational functions. The overcoming of the industrial system has been
enabled by the translation of physical acts into information. The
automation of linguistic interaction and the replacement of cognitive
and affective acts with algorithmic sequences and protocols is the main
trend of the current tranformation.

Although we can expect a process of disruption of the monetary cycle
from the inside, although alternative currencies and cryptomoney can
play a role in the disarrangement of the monetary flow, it is difficult
to guess how money, a tool for automation, can disentangle our life from
the financial automation.
