    <Content>According to writers as varied as John Locke and Karl Marx, ours is an age of money, a transitional phase in the history of humanity. Seen in this light, capitalism’s historical mission is to bring cheap commodities to the masses and to break down the insularity of traditional communities before it is replaced by a more just society. It matters where we are in this process, but opinions on that differ widely. When a third of humanity still works in the fields with their hands, I would say that capitalism still has a way to go. The Victorians believed that they stood at the pinnacle of social evolution. I think of us as being more like the first digging-stick operators, primitives stumbling into a revolution as significant as the invention of agriculture. They had no idea that it would culminate in Chinese civilization and neither can we anticipate what we could be launching now. We just know that our moment in history is an extremely dangerous one.</Content>

The task of building a global civil society for the 21st century is urgent. But we must lose a lot more before the need to rebuild world society is likely to be taken seriously. Certainly we have regressed a long way from the hopes for freedom and equality released by the Second World War and the anticolonial revolution that followed it. On the other hand, growing awareness of the risks for the future of life on this planet might encourage people to take humanity’s current predicament more seriously. The ecological (‘green’) paradigm – manifested as concern for global warming and for scarce food, water and energy supplies – could replace market fundamentalism as the religion of this emergent world society. But that will not do us much good if it entails rejecting money and markets for the illusion of local self-sufficiency.</Content>

    <Content>Capitalism has always rested on an unequal contract between owners of large amounts of money and those who make and buy their products. This contract depends on an effective threat of punishment if workers withhold their labor or buyers fail to pay up. The owners cannot make that threat alone: they need the support of governments, laws, prisons, police, even armies. By the mid-19th century, it became clear that the machine revolution was pulling unprecedented numbers of people into the cities, where they added a wholly new dimension to the traditional problem of crowd control. The political revolutions of the 1860s and 70s were based on a new and explicit alliance between capitalists and the military landlord class (who had been sworn enemies in the bourgeois revolutions) to form states capable of managing industrial workforces and of taming the criminal gangs that had taken over large swathes of the main cities. Germany and Japan provide the clearest examples of such an alliance, which took a specific form in each country.</Content>

    <Content>The 1970s were a watershed. U.S. expenditures on its losing war in Vietnam generated huge imbalances in the world’s money flows, leading to a breakdown of the fixed parity exchange-rate system devised at Bretton Woods in 1944. The dollar’s departure from the gold standard in 1971 triggered a free-for-all in world currency markets, leading immediately to the invention of money market futures. The world economy was plunged into depression in 1973 by the formation of the Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries and a hefty rise in the price of oil. ‘Stagflation’ (high unemployment and eroded purchasing power) increased, opening the way for Reagan, Thatcher, and other neoliberal conservatives to launch a counter-revolution against social democracy in the name of giving priority to ‘the market’ rather than ‘the state’. These events three decades ago and the policies pursued then find their denouement in the world’s economic crisis today.</Content>

Forty years later, these payments account for only a small fraction of global money transfers, the vast bulk being devoted to exchanging money for money in some other form (foreign exchange transactions alone reached daily turnover rates of $5.3 trillion in 2013). This rising tide of money, sometimes known as ‘the markets’, represents the apotheosis of financial capitalism, with political management of currencies and trade having been virtually abandoned in favor of freeing up the global circuit of capital. As a result, we have lived through an explosion of money, markets, and telecommunications for more than three decades and are now experiencing the consequences.</Content>

    <Content>Money is not just a means of exploitation; it also has redemptive qualities, particularly as a mediator between persons and society. Money – and the markets it sustains – is itself a human universal, with the potential to be emancipated from the social engines of inequality that it currently serves. In the late 90s, I asked what future generations will be interested in about our times and settled on the development of communications linking all humanity. This has two striking features: first, it is a highly unequal market of buyers and sellers fuelled by a money circuit that has become detached from production and politics; and second, it is driven by a digital revolution whose symbol is the internet, the network of networks. Since then I have explored how the forms of money and exchange are changing in the context of this communications revolution.</Content>

    <Content>It is always dangerous when the economy is temporarily extended beyond the reach of normal society, especially when social frontiers are pushed rapidly outwards. Our times could be compared with previous episodes in the history of global capitalism, such as the dash to build continental railroads, the gold strikes in California, Alaska, and South Africa or the wild rubber boom of the mid- to late-19th century. Many analogous episodes may be found in the mercantilist economies that emerged during the period 1500-1800. The quick wealth and cowboy entrepreneurship we have witnessed were made possible by the absence of regulation in a period of global economic expansion. We now have an opportunity to consider how world markets might be organized in the general interest.</Content>

    <Content>The residue of previous booms and busts included transport and communication systems; a mildly inflationary gold standard; new industrial uses for rubber; stock markets, and banking regulations. All the founders of modern social theory believed that the extension of society to a more inclusive level has positive features. The world economy is more integrated than it was even two decades ago; but we need new forms of political association capable of administering more effective regulatory frameworks. Fragmentation would be a disaster; but some would say it has already begun. I would not wish to return to currency controls and state-managed money, even if they were feasible. Clearly the political questions facing humanity today concern distributive justice above all. The long period of Western dominance of the world economy is coming to an end. New actors on the world stage will have their say about who gets what. An escalation of war and general fractiousness is quite likely under these circumstances. A focus on the socially redemptive qualities of money and markets might then be quite salutary.</Content>

    <Content>The current crisis of world economy is not merely financial, a phase in the historical cycle of credit and debt. The removal of political controls over money in recent decades has led to a situation where politics is still mainly national, but the money circuit is global and lawless. The crisis should rather be seen as an irreversible moment in the history of money, occasioned by the collapse of the money system that the world lived by in the 20th century. This has been unraveling since the U.S. dollar went off gold in 1971, a new regime of floating currencies emerged, and money derivatives were invented. As the need for international cooperation intensifies, the disconnection between world economy and national political institutions makes finding effective solutions very difficult.</Content>

The euro is by no means the only symptom of this crisis, but it may still come to be seen as the decisive nail in the coffin of the world economy today. We need to ask not what is beginning, but what is ending. This is not straightforward. What is ending is ‘national capitalism’, the synthesis of nation-states and industrial capitalism.</Content>

    <Content> Although his analysis was intended just to illuminate the history of money, Polanyi’s approach offers profound insight into the causes of today’s global economic crisis. Our challenge is to conceive of society once more as something plural rather than singular, as a federated network rather than as a centralized hierarchy, the nation-state. The era of national monopoly currencies is very recent (from the 1850s); it took the United States, for example, half a century to secure an uncontested monopoly for its ‘greenbacks’; and ‘all-purpose money’ has been breaking up for four decades now, since the dollar left gold.</Content>

Simmel’s prophecy has been realized to a remarkable degree, as the digital revolution accelerates and cheapens electronic transfers. But if the essence of money is its use in a community with shared social institutions, globalization has made national capitalism seem a lot less self-sufficient than it did a century ago. Radical reductions in the cost of transferring information have introduced new conditions for engagement with the impersonal economy. The replacement of single currencies by numerous types of more specialized monetary instruments is one inevitable result of this.</Content>

    <Content>We must therefore move from singular (national) to plural (federal) conceptions of society. The infrastructure of money has already become decentralized and global, so a return to the national solutions of the 1930s or a Keynesian regime of managed exchange rates and capital flows is bound to fail. But the extension of economy beyond national boundaries is fraught with danger. We also need to extend systems of social rights to the global level before the contradictions of the market system collapse into world war – but local political organization resists such a move. At the same time, ours is becoming a multi-polar world marked by a variety of political forms and an income distribution that is much less divergent than during the age of European imperialism.</Content>

    <Content>We are witnessing a global power struggle of awesome consequences and we cannot afford to stand to one side. The parallels with 1914 are striking. A global hegemon in decline, the United States (then Britain) confronts a rising challenger, China (Germany), while some regional powers are failing – Europe, Japan (Austria-Hungary, the Ottomans) – and others flex their muscles, India, Russia, Brazil (U.S., France, Japan). Money is at the heart of this struggle: the U.S. dollar, currency wars, BRICS vs. the Bretton Woods institutions; but conventional economics does not help ordinary people to grasp what is going on. By studying monetary relations on different geographical scales, from intimate encounters to foreign exchange markets, we can help create new meanings and connections between everyday life and the human predicament as a whole.</Content>

    <Content>Through the internet or phone network, we can now span the world and connect personally with people whom we will never meet. Humanity has universal media for the expression of universal ideas. Money is essential to their dissemination. It is a constitutive part of our multiple-layered identities, from the most intimate relations to communities of exchange on a vast scale. Money allows us to express ourselves and indexes our place in hierarchies, solidarities, and enclosures. Our identities expand, fragment, and recombine as we move from the most local transactions to national or regional currencies. Central banks, insurance companies, pension funds, global and local banks, savings clubs, and other local credit schemes, all shape the possibilities for our personalities to develop. We learn about politics and our membership of larger groups by participation in monetary networks that exclude and entrap us even as they extend our horizons. As Marcel Mauss knew, the idea of society itself is reshaped by this multifarious expansion.</Content>

We need to build an infrastructure of money adequate to humanity’s common needs, although this agenda seems impossibly remote right now.

    <Content> Our first basic method is inspired by the ethnographic revolution that launched social and cultural anthropology in the 20th century. A class of academics chose to break out of the ivory tower and join the people where they live in order to discover what they do, think, and want. Second, the economy is always plural and people’s experience of it across time and space has more in common that the use of contrastive terms like ‘capitalism‘ or ‘socialism’ would suggest. This approach addresses the variety of particular institutions through which most people experience economic life. Third, our aim is to promote economic democracy by helping people to organize and improve their own lives. Our findings must therefore ultimately be presented to the public in a spirit of pragmatism and made understandable for readers’ own practical use.</Content>

    <Content>All of this is compatible with a humanist view of the economy. It must be so, if the economy is to be returned from remote experts to the people who are most affected by it. But humanism by itself is not enough. The human economy must also be informed by a vision capable of bridging the gap between everyday life (what people know) and our common predicament, which is inevitably impersonal and lies beyond the actor’s point of view (what we don’t know). For this purpose a variety of methods must be drawn from philosophy, world history, literature, and grand social theory. Globalization is clearly reversible and we have to extend our normal reach to address its contradictions. We urgently need to make a world where all people can live together. Small may be beautiful and a preference for initiatives grounded in local social realities is unchallengeable, but large-scale bureaucracies, whether governments, cities or business corporations, are also essential if our aspirations for economic democracy are to embrace the movement of the world we live in.</Content>

According to Mauss and Polanyi (founders of modern social theory too), the chief way of achieving social extension has always been through money and markets in a variety of forms. Without money, most people could not juggle the plethora of institutional factors in their lives. Money and markets are intrinsic to our human potential, not anti-human as they are often depicted. Of course they should take forms that are more conducive to economic democracy. It helps to recognize that money and markets span the extremes of infinite expansion and finite closure. As Simmel said, money reflects our human potential to make universal society.</Content>

    <Content>The Human Economy idea may have its origins in small-scale informal activities and a humanist ideology, but effective resistance to the corporate takeover of world society will require selective alliances between self-organized initiatives on the ground and large-scale bureaucracies of the public and private kind. It will also require the development of global social networks of the sort from which our human economy program drew its impetus. The human predicament is impersonal; there are powerful anti-humanist forces in our common lives. So we have to build bridges between local actors and the new human universal, world society. To be human is to be a person who depends on and must make sense of impersonal social conditions. But in the struggle with the corporations, we need to be very sure that we are human and they are not. The drive for economic democracy will not be won until that confusion has been cleared up.</Content>

David Graeber has made a similar contrast between money as virtual credit and as currency or bullion to analyze the history of debt over the last five millennia. If money is the concrete symbol of our human potential to make universal society, we will first have to get past national capitalism as the 20th century’s dominant social form.</Content>

It is often portrayed as a lifeless object separated from persons, whereas it is a creation of human beings, imbued with the collective spirit of the living and the dead. Money, as a token of society, must be impersonal in order to connect individuals to the universe of relations to which they belong. But people make everything personal, including their relations with society. This two-sided relationship is universal, but its incidence is highly variable.</Content>

It helps that money, as well as being the means of separating public and domestic life, was always the main bridge between the two. That is why money must be central to any attempt to humanize society. It is both the principal source of our vulnerability in society and the main practical symbol allowing each of us to make an impersonal world meaningful.</Content>

    <Content>The reality of markets is not just universal abstraction, but this mutual determination of the abstract and the concrete. If you have some money, there is almost no limit to what you can do with it, but, as soon as you buy something, the act of payment lends concrete finality to your choice. Money’s significance thus lies in the synthesis it promotes of impersonal abstraction and personal meaning, objectification and subjectivity, analytical reason and synthetic narrative. Its social power comes from the fluency of its mediation between infinite potential and finite determination. To turn our backs on markets and money in the name of collective as opposed to individual interests reproduces by negation the bourgeois separation of self and society. It is not enough to emphasize the controls that people already impose on money and exchange as part of their personal practice.</Content>

    <Content> There are substantial parallels between the last three decades and a similar period before 1914. In both cases, market forces were unleashed within national societies, leading to rapid capital accumulation and an intensification of economic inequality. Finance capital led the internationalization of economic relations, and people migrated in large numbers all over the world. Money seemed to be the dominant social force in human affairs; and this could be attributed to its greater freedom of movement as the boundaries of society were extended outward—then by new means of transport and communication and colonial empire, now by the digital revolution and transnational corporations. The main difference is that the late-19th century was driven by a bureaucratic revolution which led to the centralization of politics and production; whereas a century later these same bureaucracies are being dismantled by a neoliberalism powered by the digital revolution in communications. Moreover, the immediate winner of ‘the second thirty years’ war’ (1914-1945) was a social democratic version of national capitalism, the same system that has been unravelling for four decades now. Finally, the United States’ overwhelming monopoly of the global means of destruction, the supremacy of the dollar as world currency, and its corporations’ dominant supply of the hardware, software and content of the internet economy suggest that its vulnerability today is somewhat less than Britain’s a century ago.</Content>

    <Content>Money opens up local societies to interdependence with foreigners, but the pressure to reassert local control persists. Hence the internal and external dimensions of economy are often in conflict. National capitalism turned away from the world in an era of war and disruption of trade into an aspiration to self-sufficiency whose symbol was national currency. On a much smaller scale community currencies of the LETS type reject money's capacity to link us to universal society in favor of local restrictions on exchange.</Content>

    <Content>I have suggested here that the extension of society to a more inclusive level has some positive features and, before we demonize money and markets, we should try to turn them to institutional ends that benefit us all. We need new principles of political association with which to put in place more effective regulatory frameworks. This means addressing squarely the new combinations of money, machines, and people emerging today. In order for that to come about, however, we have to be weaned from old social structures and habits of mind that have not yet been fully destroyed, as they would be by a period of general war of the kind that has accompanied all the major revolutions of modern history.</Content>
