# Bitcoin as Politics: Distributed Right-Wing Extremism 

### David Golumbia {.author}

Theorists of science and technology have long insisted that their
objects of study can and should often be construed as profoundly
implicated in, and at least in part constituted by, the social systems
out of which they have been produced and in which they are embedded.
Frequently this perspective is hard to reconcile with what look to be
obvious facts of common sense: jet rockets really do enable space
travel, lasers really do read and write to digital media discs,
transistors really do enable miniaturized digital devices, and so on; so
what point is there to declaring that these objects ‘are’ social or
political, as if somehow social or political will might have altered or
prevented the objects from coming into being, or enabled space travel or
miniature digital devices without the relevant technological
underpinning? Yet it is hard to deny that political and social contexts
play significant roles in the adoption and proliferation of technical
devices and methods, and the line between these roles and the literal
construction and operation of technologies is at best blurry.

In his famous 1980 essay ‘Do Artifacts Have Politics?’ technology
scholar Langdon Winner asked us to consider whether a ‘given device
might have been designed and built in such a way that it produces a set
of consequences logically and temporally prior to any of its professed
uses.’[^1] For some technologies and in some contexts, this kind of
dynamic can be hard to see, and the apparently common-sense insistence
that technologies develop autonomously, as it were, continually urges us
to reject the idea that technologies might be in part or even largely
social constructions. This is the case even when the technologies themselves, as we see
in so much promotion of computational devices and methods today, are
advertised as having socially beneficial effects. Technologies are
neutral, this view seems to suggests, when human beings use them for
ends we (whoever ‘we’ are) don’t like; they are socially embedded and
the result of democratic or social power (as determined, almost
exclusively, by markets or market-like aggregations) when they are used
for ‘good’ purposes (again, *pace* the fact that what appears good from
one point of view may appear not at all good from another). In many
ways, the very effectiveness of technologies is used as self-justifying
evidence against the view that technologies might be deeply political,
especially when the politics in question might be ones ‘we’ oppose.

Bitcoin (along with the other distributed ledger cryptocurrencies of
which it is the best-known and most widely-used exponent) provides us
with an unusually pointed example of the relationship between the social
and the technical; for unlike many technologies critiqued by scholars, Bitcoin is not a technology that fails, either altogether due to
errant premises (e.g. cold fusion) or, in part, due to social pressures
(e.g. the Betamax videocassette format). Bitcoin is a technology that
*works* – that is hard to doubt. Furthermore, it is widespread and being
adopted at a furious pace. Yet despite all that, Bitcoin *does not* work
– at least not as its advocates suggest it does. Bitcoin absolutely does
*something*, yet it does not do what many of its advocates claim it
does. Bitcoin is a technology whose social and political functions far
outstrip its technical ones. In this sense, Bitcoin can be seen as a
technical object that is structured to an unusual extent by politics.
Pushing this even further, there are salient perspectives from which
Bitcoin appears to be *mostly* a realization of these political
concerns: that is, whatever the software itself does, what ‘Bitcoin’ as
a cultural object does is to promote a politics that is visible only if
one knows where to look. In this sense, we can argue that Bitcoin is
politics masquerading as technology, or technology soliciting and
promoting a very specific politics, one that despite its public
prominence has trouble penetrating fully into some of the social spaces
into which Bitcoin provides an important entrée.

Bitcoin is promoted as an alternative form of currency, and even at
times as an alternative form of money, but neither Bitcoin’s development
nor its promulgation emerges from thoughtful analyses of money or
currency as these currently exist, let alone the thought and history
that have figured in their development. The grounding problems that
Bitcoin advocates consider central are not the ones that major thinkers
about money or currency, from the right or the left, have deemed
important. On the contrary, those grounding problems are to a lesser
degree problems endemic to current technological infrastructure
(particularly the ‘double spending problem’, or the ease of
counterfeiting digital transactions) and to a greater degree
ideological: the desire to bypass the (apparently lawful) credit card
and PayPal ‘blockade’ of WikiLeaks, on the one hand (usually mentioned
as the instigating event in the widespread use of Bitcoin), and the
desire to bypass central and/or commercial banks for either the creation
of money (as many of the more rabid advocates insist) or the provision
of financial services (the main interest of Satoshi Nakamoto’s original
Bitcoin paper), on the other.[^2] The former ideas emerge from a
specifically right-wing, libertarian, anti-government politics familiar
from much of the WikiLeaks story. The latter ideas emerge from the
profoundly ideological and overtly conspiratorial anti-Central Bank
rhetoric propagated by the extremist right in the U.S. from as far back
as the Liberty Lobby and the John Birch Society, and which despite its
overt ‘anti-bank’ rhetoric, on most thoughtful analysis, serves rather
than resists the interests of banks and big finance (despite its
anti-bank rhetoric, Bitcoin itself is now promoted by banks, investors,
and venture capitalists).[^3] Like many aspects of contemporary
political discourse, especially as it is evinced on the right, these
formations work to keep power concentrated, and their main goal is to
steer the masses of disenfranchised voters toward supporting candidates
(in particular) and policies (to a lesser extent) that, on most
reasonable accounts, actually work against their own class and even
individual interests – the most famous example being the emblematic U.S.
Tea Party protestors holding signs declaring some variant on the
expression ‘Government: Keep Your Hands Off My Medicaid’.[^4]

Scholars of money like Mary Mellor and Ann Pettifor have suggested
meaningful alternatives to the current money system, but Bitcoin has
very little in common with their analyses or their positive proposals,
which would require societal and political assent as well as technical
innovation.[^5] The lack of any valid, non-conspiratorial analysis of
our existing financial systems means that Bitcoin fails to embody any
substantial alternative to them. The reasons for this have little to do
with technology and everything to do with the financial systems in which
Bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies are embedded, systems that
instantiate the forms of social power that cannot be eliminated through
either wishful thinking or technical or even political evasion: the rich
and powerful will not become poor and powerless simply because some
people decide to operate alternate exchange economies. Lacking a robust
account of transforming these systems of power, even without Bitcoin’s
flaws, a ‘perfect’ cryptocurrency would exacerbate, rather than address,
the existing serious problems with our monetary and financial systems.
Because it operates without such an account, Bitcoin’s real utility and
purpose (and that of the cryptocurrency movement in general) can be
better understood as a ‘program’ for recruiting uninformed citizens into
a neoliberal and (nominally) anti-government political discourse,
understanding the nature and effects of which requires just the
attention to political theory and history that Bitcoin enthusiasts rail
against.

Its advocates tell us to focus on the way that Bitcoin’s intricate and
original technology promises to solve urgent political problems. But it
is not Bitcoin’s technology that fails to live up to these promises.
Rather, the flaws lie in the diagnosis itself. Like many of the most
influential ideas associated with what I and other scholars have called
*cyberlibertarianism*, enthusiasts demand we understand Bitcoin as a
welcome political intervention, but when pressed for details about that
political intervention, its advocates unfailingly turn back to technical
and engineering matters.[^6] In Bitcoin’s case this is especially
notable, because the *financial* matters Bitcoin is said to ‘fix’ are
complex, technical, and hard even for experts to understand; Bitcoin
advocates routinely reject this complexity and argue that well-regarded
economists do not know what they are talking about.[^7]

The word ‘coin’ in the name Bitcoin tends to imply *money*, and many
talk about Bitcoin as if it were money, but more sober advocates who are
a little more familiar with money talk about it almost exclusively as a
*currency*.[^8] Money and currency are not the same thing. ‘Money’, as
we use the word today and as economists define it, has three attributes:
it is a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a measure of
value.[^9] ‘Currency’ refers to the medium-of-exchange function, but it
is well known that almost *anything* can serve as a medium of exchange.
The store and measure of value functions require state (or other
overarching institutional) authorization and, historically, have
required state interventions to ensure stability – functions that
Bitcoin cannot force nations to relinquish. It is very basic economics
that ‘store of value’ and ‘medium of exchange’ are not the same thing,
yet reading Bitcoin materials it often seems as if its advocates refuse
to acknowledge they are different.[^10]

‘Money’ names the instrument in which official transactions in that
nation-state are conducted: all other things being equal, US Government
bonds have a value in US dollars, and taxes in the US must be paid in
dollars. As another economist puts it, ‘in post-Keynesian monetary
theory money is anything that will settle a legal contractual
obligation. And by the civil law of contracts, the government determines
what settles a legal monetary contractual obligation’.[^11] This is the
fundamental point, critical to all monetary theory, that Bitcoin
advocates seem unable or unwilling to recognize (and admittedly it is
what was until now a fairly arcane point of economic theory): the State
decides what money *is*, and no assertion otherwise by individuals or
groups can change that – only the law can.

The nature of money is highly complex. As the Cambridge sociologist and
political scientist Geoffrey Ingham wrote in 2004 in *The Nature of
Money*, ‘perhaps the greatest paradox is that such a commonplace as
money should give rise to so much bewilderment, controversy, and, it
must be said, error. It is not well understood’.[^12] Ingham reports
that Joseph Schumpeter, who has become the patron economist for digital
disruption, could not sort out his own ideas about money sufficiently to
complete a monograph about it, despite trying for much of his career.
Yet Bitcoin supporters continually write as if money is simple,
straightforward, that any attempt to delve into its complexities is
disinformation propounded by central bankers, and so on – despite
themselves being unwilling even to investigate the basic parameters of
the thing they claim to have bettered.

The most florid claim of Bitcoin advocates is that Bitcoin poses ‘an
existential threat to the nation-state’, because nation-states
supposedly live in fear that their hold on monetary policy via central
banks like the Federal Reserve is threatened by the existence of
alternatives to money.[^13] One of Bitcoin’s most vocal advocates, Jon
Matonis, wrote during Bitcoin’s first wave of wide publicity in 2012
that ‘Bitcoin prevents monetary tyranny’ and that ‘just as the Second
Amendment in the United States, at its core, remains the final right of
a free people to prevent their ultimate political repression, a powerful
instrument is needed to prevent a corresponding repression – State
monetary supremacy’.[^14] But as many economists have pointed out,
alternatives to national *currencies* abound – from frequent flyer miles
to credit card bonus point programs, from grocery-store coupons to
high-value goods like fine art, precious metals, and gems – and it is
only in this trivial and colloquial sense that Bitcoin is money.[^15]
None of these alternative currencies pose any threat whatsoever to
national sovereignty over money, a fact that Bitcoin advocates seem
unable to process. In fact, they make continual reference to the
superiority of gold-backed money, despite the fact that governments
fixed even the price of gold at many moments in history to tame
volatility, and in the face of current stories about gold and silver
prices being part of the conspiratorial LIBOR price fixing scandal.[^16]
This preference for gold versus what they somewhat inaccurately call the
‘fiat currency’ of nation-states only shows the ideological nature of
their assertions, since gold exists right now, is widely traded and
untraceable, largely resistant to counterfeiting, and yet is widely used
(though not as a currency peg) *by the very nation-states and central
banks* that Bitcoin advocates dislike.

The comparison with gold opens the door to the cryptopolitics that
underlie too much writing and thinking about Bitcoin. Many of its most
vociferous advocates rely on characterizations of the Federal Reserve as
a corrupt idea in and of itself, a device run by conspiratorial bankers
who want ‘the state to control everyone’s lives’.[^17] These claims are
grounded in rhetoric propounded in the U.S. and across the world by
far-Right politicians like Ron Paul, a vocal advocate of Bitcoin, whose
bald declarations about the Federal Reserve are far more ideological
than substantive in nature. Paul claims to want the abolition of the Fed
and a return to the Gold Standard, as if this would result in the kind
of absolute economic freedom libertarians demand, which is itself a line
of argument with deep connections to racist conspiracy theories in which
both Pauls have long been implicated.[^18] Yet history shows that gold
standards themselves are regulatory in nature, and no more free from
manipulation, derivation and speculation than are any other currencies;
gold itself provides clear evidence of this, in its recent price
volatility.[^19]

Such beliefs require one to ignore the direct evidence before one’s own
eyes. Precisely because it is outside of regulatory structures, Bitcoin
is particularly prone to the kinds of hoarding, dumping, derivation, and
manipulation that characterize all instruments that lack central bank
control and regulatory oversight by bodies like the SEC. Contrary to the
advocates’ claims, unregulated securities instruments are everywhere in
contemporary finance; there is convincing evidence that the inability of
the Commodities Futures Trade Commission to establish regulatory
authority over CDOs and CMOs is the proximate cause for the economic
crisis of 2008.[^20] Now the lack of regulation of Bitcoin means that
hoarders (as of December 2013, half of all Bitcoins were owned by
approximately 927 people, such fight-the-power revolutionaries as the
Winklevoss twins of Facebook infamy among them) can use all sorts of
sophisticated trading methods to manipulate the market.[^21] It means
that fly-by-night operations can come and go, stealing huge amounts of
Bitcoin for themselves (as the operators of the short-lived Silk Road
drug supermarket replacement ironically called the Sheep Marketplace
appear to have done), or being emptied out by others, all of which may
be the story of Mt. Gox.[^22]

Bitcoin’s incredible volatility and lack of regulation, celebrated by
cyberlibertarians, actually prevent the cryptocurrency from being used
in just the way its advocates claim. The very reason central banks
regulate the value of currencies is to ensure one of the three major
functions of money: to be a stable source of value. The Bitcoin
experiment demonstrates a law of finance that has never yet been
disproven: absolutely unregulated markets result in extreme boom and
bust cycles.[^23] If Bitcoin becomes regulated enough to serve as a
stable store of value and to ensure debacles like Mt. Gox don’t happen
in the future, it may be useful as a global system of payments (but so
are generally non-transformative technologies like PayPal and Dwolla).
But that will hardly shake world political structures at their
foundations. If it remains outside of all forms of both value and
transactional regulation, Bitcoin will continue to be a very dangerous
place for any but the most risk-tolerant among us (i.e., the very
wealthy, whose interest in Bitcoin should indicate to advocates how and
why it cannot be economically transformative) to put our hard-earned
money.

As Bitcoin hit an all-time high (albeit briefly) of more than U.S.\$ 900
mark in late 2013, it wasn’t hard to find – in fact it was difficult to
avoid – cyberlibertarians of all stripes celebrating this surge and
similar ones in the past as proof of Bitcoin’s importance.[^24] While
the surge does indicate something, it is beyond remarkable to read
celebrations of the surge as if it demonstrates Bitcoin’s feasibility as
what it is advertised to be, a currency: because it is only through an
incredibly blinkered and uninformed worldview, one typical of the
paradoxes found throughout cyberlibertarian discourse, that dramatic
surges in the (relative) value of an instrument can be understood this
way, since under any conventional economic theory such surges prove
*not* that it is a new government-toppling currency, but to the
contrary, that it is nearly *useless* as a currency. Like so many other
parts of cyberlibertarian discourse, Bitcoin’s supposed power is so
fully and transparently perched on blatant contradictions that it is
surprising to find people taking it seriously, and yet if anything
exposure of these contradictions seems only to inspire a renewed
seriousness and missionary zeal on the part of Bitcoin advocates.

In many ways this is a familiar story about the arrogance of those who
identify strongly with ‘the digital’. Engineers imagine that their
domain-specific knowledge translates into universal knowledge (‘guys
[who] are really good at what they do, and [who] think that makes them
an expert at everything’[^25]); that all problems are engineering
problems and that unsolved problems simply indicate that nobody as smart
as they are has come along to solve those problems; that domain-specific
knowledge is a kind of ‘elitism’ meant to keep out true experts like
them.[^26] It’s also a story about the permeability of
cyberlibertarianism to Tea Party-style libertarianism, as lurking under
the celebration of Bitcoin is an endorsement of Ron Paul-ite
conspiratorial assertions about monetary policy that do not stand up to
scrutiny, even, for the most part, from more reputable Right and
Libertarian economists.[^27] Together, we have the spectacle of rabid
cyberlibertarians like Pirate Party leader Rick Falkvinge promoting
Bitcoin *because it displays exactly those features that disqualify it
for its putative use*. While Falkvinge may be the most visible and
loudest advocate of this contradictory ‘analysis’, one need only check
the comment boards for any article raising critical questions about the
economics of Bitcoin to see it being repeated, *ad nauseum*, and in a
typically trolling and dismissive style of any point of view not based
directly on grasping the genius of the Bitcoin algorithm.[^28]

To see this, one need only start at the beginning. Bitcoin is touted as
a replacement for ‘fiat currency’. Although it has a longstanding basis
in many economic theories, ‘fiat currency’ is today mostly a buzzword
from the extreme edge of libertarian economics and especially from
Paulites. The ordinary definition of ‘fiat currency’ is:

> **Fiat money** is money that derives its value from government
> regulation or law. The term **fiat currency** is used when the fiat
> money acts as the main currency of the country. The term derives from
> the Latin *fiat* (‘let it be done’, ‘it shall be’)
>
> The Nixon Shock of 1971 ended the direct convertibility of the United
> States dollar to gold. Since then all reserve currencies have been
> fiat currencies, including the U.S. dollar and the Euro.[^29]

In the simplest terms, ‘fiat money’ is money without ‘intrinsic value’ –
that is, where the token used as currency for that money has reasonable
value in another context. The most typical example of non-fiat currency
is gold, because gold has many uses and is still valuable even when not
in circulation as currency; paper money, on the other hand, is taken to
be fiat because the paper on which it is printed is nearly valueless as
paper. This distinction is actually much harder to make than advocates
want us to think; more on this below. As the Wikipedia entry goes on,
‘while gold- or silver-backed representative money entails the legal
requirement that the bank of issue redeem it in fixed weights of gold or
silver, fiat money’s value is unrelated to the value of any physical
quantity. Even a coin containing valuable metal may be considered fiat
currency if its face value is higher than its market value as metal’.

What is supposed to be wrong with fiat money? This is an age-old story
for ideologues to the right of economic libertarians; it’s one of the
favored talking points of the Paul clan.[^30] The supposed problem with
fiat currency is that it makes impossible one of the three functions of
money: its role as a *store of value*. The stability of value they claim
(erroneously) proceeds from either the use of valuable instruments as
currency (e.g., gold used for coinage) or as a grounding mechanism for
money itself (i.e., using a ‘gold standard’ for a nation’s money supply)
– while these two concepts are not at all the same, they are frequently
blurred in gold-bug propaganda – not just economic instability but
actual totalitarian political power is the inevitable result. As Ron
Paul himself put it in 2003 before the U.S. House of Representatives,
‘if unchecked, the economic and political chaos that comes from currency
destruction inevitably leads to tyranny’.[^31]

What people like Paul supposedly hate about ‘fiat’ currencies is that
‘central bankers’ can manipulate the value of the currency, supposedly
unlike asset-backed currencies like gold. The whole point of this is to
have a stable currency. A currency whose value does not fluctuate
wildly. But because Bitcoin is completely uncontrolled, it cannot
separate its asset from currency functions. That means that when it
appears to be deflating, investors (i.e. ‘hoarders’) will jump in, as
they are doing now. The problem with this is that, in just the way the
libertarians scream about, it makes the instrument *too volatile to use
as a store of value*.

The problem with ‘fiat currency’ is value fluctuation. The most
dangerous kind of value fluctuation is the deflationary spiral – it’s
usually considered worse, even, than the kind of inflationary spiral
experienced in the 1990s and 2000s by the Zimbabwean dollar. That is, a
merchant cannot hold onto their Bitcoins as profit, because they have no
guarantee that their profits will be worth the amount they were when
they took the profit. The 6 Bitcoins I get for selling a lawnmower
today, may (likely will) only buy me a box of cereal tomorrow. This
forces people to constantly transfer their Bitcoins into the
supposedly-outdated national currencies underpinning Bitcoin, which are
actually necessary for it, rather than being the old-fashioned
predecessors to it.

Which world currency is currently experiencing among the most dramatic
deflationary spirals anyone has ever seen? Bitcoin itself, the
‘existential threat to the liberal nation state’.[^32] Any sane person
putting their life’s savings into Bitcoin among all world currencies
right now is as foolish as a Dutch person buying tulips bulbs. That is
because the problems with currencies actually aren’t formal, or
mechanical, or algorithmic, despite what Bitcoin propagandists
desperately want us to believe. They are social and political problems
that can only be solved by political mechanisms. That is why, despite
the rhetoric of Bitcoin advocates, right now most sovereign currencies
are far more stable than Bitcoin will ever or can ever be (since Bitcoin
has no mechanism for value control whatsoever, and its eventual limit to
a total number of coins is designed to be deflationary, apparently due
to a built-in conspiratorial and typically right-wing suspicion of
inflation). Bitcoin advocates have an historically-disproven belief that
lack of regulation produces stability – when the historical data shows
time and time again that lack of regulation produces boom-and-bust
cycles of an intensity far greater than the central bank regulation
Bitcoin advocates loathe so much.

Many economists recognize something that appears to have been beyond the
inventors and advocates of Bitcoin. Without direct regulatory structures
that prevent an instrument from being used as an investment (aka
‘hoarding’), any instrument (*even gold*) will be subject to derivation,
securitization, and ultimately extreme boom-and-bust cycles that central banks are tasked to prevent. The more Bitcoin
fluctuates in value, the less functional it can be as a currency. The
less impact it can have on ‘world governments’, whatever that is
supposed to mean. *The more Bitcoin ‘rises in value’* – *that is,
experiences radical deflationary spirals* – *the more it fails to be
money.*

In fact, because the cycles of rapid deflation and inflation provoke
constant exchanges of Bitcoin for other stores of value, usually
national currencies, Bitcoin can more readily be understood not merely
as a commodity, as just one among many other digital commodities, but
also as a kind of derivative itself – an option or futures contract
related to the value of other instruments and on which investors of all
sorts can speculate and, depending on the volume of transactions, even
manipulate the market. Given Bitcoin’s foundational anti-regulatory
stance, it is almost inconceivable that major players are refraining
from such manipulation. Thus the involvement of high-profile players
like the Winkelvoss twins, too, cannot be a cause for celebration of
Bitcoin’s potential as a currency, but rather demonstrates its utility
as a manipulable commodity for typical, existing capital to use to its
own ends. In this sense, it becomes a tool for existing power to
concentrate itself, rather than a challenge to the existing order – as
many of its more economically-informed commentators consistently point
out, ‘more like a speculative investment than a currency’.[^33]

Few attitudes typify the paradoxical digital libertarian mindset of
Bitcoin promoters (and many others) more than those of ‘Sanjuro’, the
alias of the person who created the Bitcoin ‘assassination market’
written up by Andy Greenberg.[^34] He believes that by incentivizing
people to kill politicians, he will destroy ‘all governments,
everywhere’. This ‘will change the world for the better’, producing ‘a
world without wars, dragnet panopticon-style surveillance, nuclear
weapons, armies, repression, money manipulation, and limits to trade’.
While not directly about the revolutionary powers of Bitcoin, the
sentiment flows from the same fount of misguided computational ‘wisdom’.
Only someone so blinkered by their ideological tunnel vision could look
at world history and imagine that murdering democratic governments out
of existence would do anything but make every one of these problems
immeasurably worse than they already are.

To be fully accurate, Bitcoin is not really a piece of software on its
own – or rather, it is software written using a model that is applicable
both to other very similar pieces of software (other cryptocurrencies
like Litecoin, Dogecoin, and so on), and also to a wide array of other
technical functions. The concept of the cryptographically-enabled
distributed ledger, and the ‘blockchain’ used to implement it by current
cryptocurrencies, advocates tell us, have wide application outside of
their uses: a technology as revolutionary today as were ‘personal
computers in 1975, the internet in 1993’, we hear not infrequently.[^35]
Networks built on such technologies are *technically* decentralized, we
are told, in a way that the current internet is not, and thus allow a
range of services and opacity to inspection (and therefore legal as well
as unlawful surveillance). Advocates are right that it is difficult to
grasp the potential uses of such networks without seeing them in action,
but on the surface they seem structured around promises that appeal to
and reinforce specific political ideologies.[^36] These are almost
exclusively ideologies that are broadly libertarian in character and
that serve the neoliberal agenda: they follow Friedrich Hayek and his
disciple Jimmy Wales in believing that markets, not formal political
structures, are the only valid means for knowledge to be gained and
power to be wielded, and that ‘the good will win out’ if we impose
competitive market structures over parts of society, like the issuance
of money, that governments have claimed as part of their domain. Despite
their frequent use of the word ‘democratization’, such efforts are
profoundly anti-democratic, insisting that the introduction of devices
and software by a self-identified technocratic elite trumps duly-enacted
laws and law enforcement mechanisms, and that a kind of market – a
market in adoption of such services – is the exclusive method society
should use to judge the provision of these services. The most fervent
advocates of such strategies are open in their rejection of democratic
governance:

> ‘We see this as part of the total sublation of the state’, said Cody
> Wilson […] who gained fame earlier this year when he published online
> the blueprints to a pistol that could be manufactured with a 3D
> printer. ‘I know I sound like some kind of weird Jehovah’s Witness,
> but we’ve only just begun. We admit that we are ideologues.’[^37]

There was a time when it would have been relatively difficult to imagine
a software platform that had more power in a political sphere than in its stated
uses; it also used to be hard to imagine right-wing extremists like Cody
Wilson being quoted as authoritative about anything in our nation’s
leading newspapers. It is an index of Bitcoin’s power as ideology that
today such statements pass without notice, and it is no less an index of
the threat such technologies pose to democracy itself.[^38] It is a
threat the advocates of such technologies themselves frequently
advertise, and it is this feature of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies that
political thinkers of different orientations need to take seriously.
